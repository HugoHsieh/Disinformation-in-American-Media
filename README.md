# Disinformation-in-American-Media
Summary: Analyzing disinformation in American media, 2007-2016.

This is the course project of Data Science and Public Policy at Columbia University in 2024. I co-worked with Gaby Gerecht, Gloria Gerhardt, and Senandung Luluk.

•	Visualized 13K dataset by Pandas and Matplotlib to show speakers’ likelihood of spreading rumors under different scenarios, including contexts and subjects; revealed importance of social media in regulating fake news

•	Analyzed disinformation by running OLS regression to investigate factors driving spread of fake news; identified a significant positive correlation (p-value < 0.02) between election competitiveness and disinformation rate
